Contribution
============
Thank you for considering to contribute!

If you want to contribute, feel free to open a pull request.
`This <https://akrabat.com/the-beginners-guide-to-contributing-to-a-github-project/>`_ manual is a good start on how to
contribute to open source projects.

Please write tests for the features you want to add and make sure to not add dependencies on additional libraries
(if avoidable).
We highly appreciate bug fixes (or reports), improvements on the documentation, and tests.
However, we would be hesitant to add new annotators.
If you have an idea for a new annotator we would be happy to reference your annotator in a separate repository
or PyPI package.
